Your mission is to figure out strategies to tackle the puzzle. in this stage, reasoning is of great value, here's what you should do:

- Read the question in `question.md`.
- Review the question, identify what you get as input, what you want as output, and the operating mechanism to turn input to output.
- Progressively analyze and illation the path to turn the mechanism to computational algorithm, and pursue the best performance. Sometimes the optimum solution can vary greatly with the change in the magnitude of certain parameters, so in different cases, you need different approaches, and exceptions always occur in different situations, so check all the possibilities.
- Save your analysis in `analysis.md` in the same directory, it needs to be in Markdown format. I recommend the template below:

# Analysis for (title of the question)

## Insights

(Show your observation and deduction of the question, there're some fixed patterns existing in inputs and outputs, and hidden logic inside the mechanism, they can serve as key insights of the question)

---

## Breakthroughs for case 1 (Based on your deduction and knowledge, you should brainstorm **multiple** methods, starting from the most intuitive, simple yet sluggish one to the most complex but performant one)

(when if fits case 1)

**Method 1: (method 1 name)**:
- Strategy: (briefly conclude how this method solve the question)
- Steps: (brief and simplified steps showing how this method work)
    (step 1) => (step 2) => (step 3) => (step 4) => ...
- Evaluation: (briefly evaluate time/space complexity)

**Method 2: (method 2 name)**:
- Strategy: (briefly conclude how this method solve the question)
- Steps: (brief and simplified steps showing how this method work)
    (step 1) => (step 2) => (step 3) => (step 4) => ...
- Evaluation: (briefly evaluate time/space complexity)

## (optional, if there is other cases) Breakthroughs for case 2

(Repeat the template of case 1)
